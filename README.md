# PhiZone Player

![PhiZone Player Banner](resources/banner.png)

PhiZone Player is an HTML5 Phigros chart player/simulator based on Phaser.

### Frameworks

This project is made possible by:

- [Phaser](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser)
- [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit)
- [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)

## Introduction

Much of this program resembles any other Phigros chart player/simulator, so this section will focus solely on its unique features.

### User-friendly landing page

Designed with [Preline UI](https://preline.co/) and [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/), the landing page is meticulously written to be as intuitive yet powerful as possible.

Choose either some files (or .zip/.pez archives) or an entire folder, and chart bundles will be automatically detected according to Re: PhiEdit (or RPE) metadata files (typically named `info.txt`) in which a chart, a song, and an illustration are specified. Any other files that fail to be recognized, which are most likely multimedia that will be referenced by the chart, or the `extra.json` from Phira, will be presented in the assets.

On desktop platforms, you can open .zip/.pez archives directly with the PhiZone Player app.

On mobile platforms, you can share chart archives to the app so that it can receive and resolve them.

Additionally, the program can automatically download files from URLs specified in the `zip` and `file` search parameters. A `zip` parameter should be provided a URL to a zip archive, while a `file` parameter should be provided a URL to a regular file.

### Innovative keyboard controls

Similar to a video player, the program includes handy keyboard controls that are available in autoplay/practice mode:

- Pause/Resume: Press <kbd>Space</kbd> to toggle. (In practice mode, press <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> to pause.)
- Rewind/Forward: Use <kbd>←</kbd> / <kbd>→</kbd> to jump 5 seconds, or <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd> / <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd> for precise 0.1-second adjustments.

Besides, <kbd>ESC</kbd> is always available to pause with/resume from the pause screen, and you can use alphanumeric and punctuation keys on your keyboard to hit the notes when autoplay is off.

### APNG support

Animated PNGs are an excellent alternative to GIFs, offering enhanced color fidelity and the support of an 8-bit alpha channel for smoother transparency effects.

An APNG acts exactly the same way as a GIF does, unless the number of repetitions is specified in the file, according to the APNG specification.

### Z indexes

The Z index (depth) defines the order in which game objects are rendered. The lower the value, the earlier they are rendered.

| Default Z index (depth) | Object(s)                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0                       | Illustration                                                               |
| 1                       | Background video, if present                                               |
| [2, 3)                  | Judgment lines, the order of which are determined by their `zOrder` values |
| 3                       | Hold notes                                                                 |
| 4                       | Drag notes                                                                 |
| 5                       | Tap notes                                                                  |
| 6                       | Flick notes                                                                |
| 7                       | Hit effects                                                                |
| 8                       | Pause button                                                               |
| 9                       | Combo counter                                                              |
| 10                      | Text beneath the combo counter                                             |
| 11                      | Score                                                                      |
| 12                      | Std deviation & accuracy                                                   |
| 13                      | Progress bar                                                               |
| 14                      | Song title                                                                 |
| 15                      | Level name & difficulty                                                    |

The Z indexes of judgment lines whose `zIndex` is not present (see [Chart enhancements](#chart-enhancements)) are calculated based on their `zOrder` values ([code here](https://github.com/PhiZone/player/blob/ed8a6119a28c8594d372aacb8e1da12fdce6d692/src/player/utils.ts#L595)). Simply put, the values are mapped onto [0, 1) and made equally spaced, and then get added by 2 to become Z indexes. See examples below.

| `zOrder`           | Z index               |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| 0, 10, 20, 30      | 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75    |
| 127, 0, 0, 1       | 2.6667, 2, 2, 2.3333  |
| 1, 2, 5, 6, 114514 | 2, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8 |

### Chart enhancements

Aside from adding support for RPE features, we've also designed some original properties for judgment lines & notes.

| Property             | Value(s)                                            | Example                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `scaleOnNotes`       | `0`: none; `1`: scale; `2`: clip                    | `"scaleOnNotes": 2`             | Belongs to a judgment line. Decides how `scaleX` events affect notes. Defaults to `0`.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `appearanceOnAttach` | `0`: hidden; `1`: white colored; `2`: FC/AP colored | `"appearanceOnAttach": 2`       | Belongs to a judgment line. Decides how the line will be displayed when a UI component or any video is attached to it. Color events will override the color defined by these options. Defaults to `0`.                                                                         |
| `zIndex`             | an integer or a float                               | `"zIndex": 3.5`                 | Belongs to a judgment line or note. Sets the Z index for the object. For a judgment line, this property, if set, overrides the `zOrder` property, allowing for more control over on which layer the line should be displayed. For default values, see [Z indexes](#z-indexes). |
| `zIndexHitEffects`   | an integer or a float                               | `"zIndexHitEffects": 6.5`       | Belongs to a note. Sets the Z index for the hit effects of the note. Defaults to `7`.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `tint`               | [R, G, B], as seen in `colorEvents`; `null`         | `"tint": [255, 0, 0]`           | Belongs to a note. Sets the tint for the note. Defaults to `null`.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `tintHitEffects`     | [R, G, B], as seen in `colorEvents`; `null`         | `"tintHitEffects": [255, 0, 0]` | Belongs to a note. Sets the tint for the hit effects of the note. Defaults to `null`.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Video enhancements

Support for videos in `extra.json` gets extended with the following new properties for each entry in the `videos` list:

| Property | Type   | Description                                                                                 |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `zIndex` | Number | Determines the Z index for this video. Defaults to `1`.                                     |
| `attach` | Object | Attaches this video to a judgment line, if this property is present. See below for details. |

Properties residing in the `attach` object:

| Property                     | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `line`                       | Number | Determines which line this video is attached to.                                                                                                  |
| `positionXFactor` (optional) | Number | Multiplied by the x position of the line, determines the x position of this video. Defaults to `1`.                                               |
| `positionYFactor` (optional) | Number | Multiplied by the y position of the line, determines the y position of this video. Defaults to `1`.                                               |
| `rotationFactor` (optional)  | Number | Multiplied by the rotation of the line, determines the rotation of this video. Defaults to `1`.                                                   |
| `alphaFactor` (optional)     | Number | Multiplied by the alpha of the line, determines the alpha of this video, together with the `alpha` property of the video itself. Defaults to `1`. |
| `tintFactor` (optional)      | Number | Multiplied by the tint of the line, determines the tint of this video. Defaults to `1`.                                                           |
| `scaleXMode` (optional)      | Number | Determines how `scaleX` events of the line affect this video. Values same as in `scaleOnNotes`. Defaults to `0`.                                  |
| `scaleYMode` (optional)      | Number | Determines how `scaleY` events of the line affect this video. Values same as in `scaleOnNotes`. Defaults to `0`.                                  |

### Shader enhancements

Except for WebGL's incompatibilities with newer versions of GLSL, the program supports not only all the shader features defined by `extra.json`, but also one original addition to the standard: **target range**.

A target range defines a list of depth-adjacent (next to each other on the Z axis) game objects that a shader event is applied to. It belongs directly to a shader event (as the optional `targetRange` property) and consists of the following properties:

| Property               | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `minZIndex`            | Number  | Defines the minimum Z index (depth) of this range. Inclusive.                                                                                                                           |
| `maxZIndex`            | Number  | Defines the maximum Z index (depth) of this range. Exclusive.                                                                                                                           |
| `exclusive` (optional) | Boolean | Determines whether this range should exclude the range of another active shader event when the two ranges intersect but this range is not a superset of the other. Defaults to `false`. |

If the `global` property of a shader event is set to `true`, then its `targetRange` will not function.

One thing to note is that a single object cannot be rendered in parallel by two or more shaders. However, a set of targets from one shader event can be safely contained within the targets of another shader event. This leads to the concept of the `exclusive` property - it determines whether or not to "swallow" another set of objects when it intersects with but is not a subset of the current.

```jsonc
{
  // ...
  "effects": [
    {
      "start": [293, 0, 1],
      "end": [300, 0, 1],
      "shader": "/example.glsl",
      "global": false,
      "targetRange": {
        "minZIndex": 3,
        "maxZIndex": 4,
      }, // Hold notes
      "vars": {
        // ...
      },
    },
    {
      "start": [293, 0, 1],
      "end": [463, 0, 1],
      "shader": "/example.glsl",
      "global": false,
      "targetRange": {
        "minZIndex": 8,
        "maxZIndex": 16,
      }, // The entire UI
      "vars": {
        // ...
      },
    },
    {
      "start": [66, 0, 1],
      "end": [296, 0, 1],
      "shader": "/another-example.glsl",
      "global": true,
      // targetRange is optional
      "vars": {
        // ...
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

Notice that there are two events that share the same shader code. This is a workaround when you want to apply the same shader to objects that are not adjacent on the Z axis.

<sup>1</sup> Support for fragment shaders is partial, due to WebGL relying on an older version of GLSL.  
<sup>2</sup> The app currently shows up for `application/zip` and `application/octet-stream` files on Android and any type of files on iOS/iPadOS. This is not the desired behavior and is subject to change.

A version is reached whenever at least one feature from this version is marked as `🚧 Working`, and all features from the previous versions are marked as `✅ Done`. A version is released only when all features from this version and the previous versions are marked as `✅ Done`.
